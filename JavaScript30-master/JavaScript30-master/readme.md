Each episode is a small project, rather self explanatory, but created using only Vanilla Javascript. 
Some projects, such as the Array Cardio episodes, only show output in the console so if you would like to view them, please open the console.
The spedometer only works for Mac and I created the project on Windows so the example is directly from Wes Bos
